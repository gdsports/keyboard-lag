Tokaku "Keyboard polling rate matters, here's why | osu! & Etterna" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heZVmr9fyng

USB polling rate: The rate at which USB hosts checks a USB device such
as a keyboard or gamepad for input. Old devices using USB Low
Speed (1.5 MBits/sec) which has a maximum polling rate of 8 ms. Newer
devices using USB Full Speed or higher (12 Mbits/sec or higher).

Key polling rate: The rate at which the CPU inside the keyboard or
gamepad checks the keys/buttons/joysticks for changes in
keys/buttons/sticks. This rate is usually much slower than the USB
polling rate because of contact debouncing. Keyboards with LED
animation effects may also ignore keyboard scanning while is updating
the LEDs.
