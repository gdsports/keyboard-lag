NSGadget_HID running on an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0 Express connected to
an computer running Ubuntu 18.04 AMD64.

bInterval = 1 and Linux polls every 1 ms as requested. When the same
board running NSGadget_HID is connected to a Nintendo Switch, the
Switch ignores bInterval and polls every 7 ms. This is true for the
USB port on the back of the dock, the 2 USB ports on the side of the
dock, and the USB type C port on the bottom of the Switch.
